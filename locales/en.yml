  greetings:
    - 'Hello, {}!'
    - 'Hi, {}'
    - 'How are you, {}!'
    - 'Hi, bro 😉'
    - 'How do you do!'
  phrases_about_myself:
    - 'Super!'
    - 'Thank you, everything is OK.'
    - 'Alright'
    - 'Excellent!'
    - 'Нормально, но в последнее время некогда тренироваться'
    - 'Хорошо, бегаю тут потихоньку'
    - '"Занимаюсь ресинтезом гликогена". Такой ответ на вопрос "Что делаешь?" звучит куда научнее и солиднее, чем "Пью сладкий чай с вафлями и пряниками после бега на пятьдесят километров". Сразу ясно, что человек не просто лежит на диване, вытянув свои убегавшиеся ноги, а занят серьезным делом.'
